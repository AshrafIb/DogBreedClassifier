# DogBreedClassifier

This repository is for my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone project. In this project it was about setting up a CNN, which can identify dog breeds. 
A detailed discussion of my approach can be found on Medium: 

# 1. Motivation and Overview

The motivation was to create a CNN, which can classify dog breeds and to try to improve this CNN in various ways. At the same time it was about understanding to what extent one can work with pre-trained models. For this reason I decided to use the InceptionV3. 

# 2. Steps of Analysis

1.Detecting Humans (based on OpenCV's Face-Classifier) 
2.Detecting Dogs (using ResNet-50 pretrained Model)
3.Create a CNN from Scratch 
4.Using a CNN to Classify Dog-Breeds
5.Creating a CNN to Classify Dog-Breeds
6.Writing my final Algorithm 
7.Testing my Model
8.Final Thoughts

## 3 Model Performance

Accuracy of final Model: 81%.
